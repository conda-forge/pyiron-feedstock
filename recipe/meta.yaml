  summary: pyiron - an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science.
  description: |
    pyiron was initially developed in the Computational Materials Design department of Joerg Neugebauer at the
    Max Planck Insitut fÃ¼r Eisenforschung (Max Planck Insitute for iron research) as a framework for ab initio
    thermodynamics. In collaboration with the Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation (ICAMS)
    the framework was recently extended for high throughput applications resulting in the opensource release of
    pyiron.
